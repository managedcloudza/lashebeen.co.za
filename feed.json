            "content_html": "<p>Ah, chicken wings, the culinary sensation that transcends language barriers, cultural divides, and apparently, even the dictionary itself! Here at \"La Shebeen,\" we take our chicken wings seriously, with a side of humor and a dash of linguistic ambiguity.</p>\n<p>So, let's talk about \"waddage,\" shall we? According to our very special guest, Ross, \"waddage\" means something that's large. And when it comes to our chicken wings, they're so \"waddage\" that they might just redefine your perception of what's possible in the world of wings.</p>\n<p>But wait, there's more! According to the Urban Dictionary, \"waddage\" has an entirely different meaning that we won't delve into here – let's just say it involves some creative uses for public paper towels. Yeah, we'll stick with the \"large and in charge\" definition, thanks!</p>\n<p>And if you thought \"waddage\" was just a quirky word, think again. According to Google Translate, \"waddage\" translates to \"road\" in Somali. Now, we're not entirely sure how that connects to chicken wings, but hey, language is a mysterious thing, and maybe there's a chicken wing road we don't know about!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17.jpeg\" alt=\"La Shebeen chicken wings ready to eat\" width=\"899\" height=\"1599\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px\" srcset=\"https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17-md.jpeg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/7/responsive/WhatsApp-Image-2023-11-12-at-17.46.17-xl.jpeg 1360w\"></figure>\n<p>But back to the star of the show – our world-famous chicken wings.

This wasn’t your average liquor; oh no, it was so refined and clear, it had the Russians nodding with approval from across the globe, raising their glasses to the sky and saying, “That’s how you turn 40.”</p>\n<p>As the evening unfolded, the dance floor became a melting pot of moves from decades past— a wrinkle in time, if you will. There were enough spins, dips, and Saturday night fever poses to make John Travolta quiver in his boots. And when the beat dropped, so did any pretense of adulthood. Because at La Shebeen, age is just a number, but dance is eternal.</p>\n<p>Every laugh, every toast, every “cheers” to Fabien’s questionable maturity level made the evening sparkle brighter than the twinkle in his eye when he spotted the vodka bottle. It’s safe to say that the water of life was so pure, it could be served in a health spa.</p>\n<p>And to Fabien, our VIP of the hour who proved you can be forty and still party like it’s 1999— your joy was contagious, your spirits were high, and your liver, well, resilient.</p>\n<p>As the night drew to a close, the only thing clearer than that top-shelf vodka was the love and friendship filling the room—proof that the best way to age is surrounded by good people and great drinks.</p>\n<p>To all who came, laughed, and sipped the night away: thank you from the bottom of our hearts (and the bottom of the bottle). You’ve made Fabien’s leap into the “Fab Forties” as memorable as that vodka was forgettable.</p>\n<p>Here’s to nights we’ll always remember with friends we’ll never forget...and to vodka so smooth, it's basically water—Fabien-style.</p>\n<p>With affection and a hint of aspirin, The La Shebeen Team</p>\n<p>P.S. Don’t worry, your secrets are safe with us. What happens at La Shebeen stays at La Shebeen... until it ends up in our commemorative photo album. Cheers to the next 40, Fabien! 🥳🍸</p>",
