                    <p><img src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/1735147446557.jpeg" class="type:primaryImage" alt="" /></p>
                <p>La Shebeen, where the ambiance is as crafted as the drinks we pour. If you’ve ever visited—or been lucky enough to find us—you might have noticed something unusual: no thumping basslines, no curated playlists, and certainly no overplayed chart-toppers humming in the background. That’s right, La Shebeen has no music.</p>
<p>Before you raise your perfectly arched eyebrows and mutter, “What kind of bar doesn’t play music?” let us explain. We didn’t stumble into this decision accidentally. It’s a deliberate choice, born out of our philosophy, our identity, and, dare we say, our rebellion against the noise.</p>
<h3>1. <strong>The Lost Art of Conversation</strong></h3>
<p>Remember the last time you had a meaningful conversation in a bar? Neither do we. Somewhere along the way, loud music replaced the low hum of human connection. At La Shebeen, we believe in bringing it back. Here, you don’t need to yell over a speaker just to discuss life, love, or your questionable choices.</p>
<p>We provide the space; you bring the stories.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/1735147446891.jpeg" alt="" width="297" height="528" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446891-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446891-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446891-md.jpeg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446891-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446891-xl.jpeg 1360w"></figure>
<h3>2. <strong>We’re Not Competing with Spotify</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s be honest, no one can agree on a playlist. One person’s “banger” is another person’s headache. Instead of trying to cater to everyone’s eclectic tastes, we’ve decided to opt out entirely. Why play middleman when you’ve got your own earbuds at home?</p>
<p>What we do offer is a selection of locally crafted drinks as diverse as your music library. Pair your favorite Cape Town craft beer with the sweet sound of laughter. Trust us, it’s a vibe.</p>
<h3>3. <strong>Authenticity Over Atmosphere</strong></h3>
<p>Plenty of bars rely on music to create a mood. At La Shebeen, the mood is created by the people who walk through our doors. Our atmosphere isn’t built on speakers and subwoofers—it’s in the clink of glasses, the shared smiles, and the collective warmth of being somewhere that feels a little off the beaten path.</p>
<p>Think of us as a sanctuary from the chaos.</p>
<figure class="post__image align-left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/1735147446632.jpeg" alt="" width="294" height="523" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446632-xs.jpeg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446632-sm.jpeg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446632-md.jpeg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446632-lg.jpeg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/17/responsive/1735147446632-xl.jpeg 1360w"></figure>
<h3>4. <strong>The Soundtrack is Local</strong></h3>
<p>Cape Town is alive with its own music—the crashing of waves, the whisper of mountain breezes, the rhythm of city streets. Why compete with that? Step into La Shebeen, and you’re stepping into a space that honors its surroundings, rather than drowning them out.</p>
<h3>5. <strong>Because Silence is Golden (and Underrated)</strong></h3>
<p>Alright, maybe not <em>silence</em>—there’s always someone debating the merits of Karoo agave versus Hout Bay gin. But the absence of music creates something rare: the ability to simply be present. To enjoy your drink without distraction. To let your thoughts breathe.</p>
<h3>What’s the Catch?</h3>
<p>We won’t lie—our no-music policy isn’t for everyone. If you’re looking for a nightclub or a dance floor, La Shebeen isn’t your spot. La Shebeen is not a disco. But if you’re seeking a bar where your voice matters more than the volume, you’ve found your place.</p>
<p>So come in, pull up a chair, and let the conversation flow. At La Shebeen, we’ve got the drinks covered—you just bring the words.</p>
<p>Cheers to a quieter kind of nightlife.<br>— The La Shebeen Team</p>

                <p>If you know us at La Shebeen, you know we take our drinks seriously. Whether it’s a perfectly poured Cape Town craft beer, a bottle of Hout Bay gin, or a Karoo agave delight, we’re all about championing the best our region has to offer. So, when we decided it was time to level up our wine selection, we headed straight to the heart of Stellenbosch—Spier Wine Estate.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: we didn’t leave empty-handed.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/IMG_20241216_174214.jpg" alt="La Shebeen stocked up with Spier wines" width="4000" height="1800" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_20241216_174214-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_20241216_174214-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_20241216_174214-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_20241216_174214-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/16/responsive/IMG_20241216_174214-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>

<h3>The Journey to Wine Nirvana 🍷</h3>
<p>Picture this: rolling vineyards stretching to the horizon, the crisp Stellenbosch air, and us walking into the Spier tasting room like kids in a candy store. Our mission? To sample their lineup of whites, rosés, and reds and see if Spier could live up to its legendary reputation.</p>
<p>The first pour was a crisp white that danced on the palate like a summer breeze. Next came the rosé—a delicate yet bold expression of everything we love about South African wine. And then... the reds. Full-bodied, complex, and unapologetically delicious. It was like each glass was trying to outdo the last. Spoiled for choice doesn’t even begin to describe it.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Love at First Sip</h3>
<p>By the time we made it through the tasting, the decision was unanimous: Spier wasn’t just good. It was <em>extraordinary</em>. These wines weren’t just something we enjoyed—they were something we needed to share with you.</p>
<p>After a spirited (and wine-fueled) team meeting, we decided to make Spier Wines the official standard at La Shebeen. Whether you’re into a zesty Sauvignon Blanc, a flirty rosé, or a bold Shiraz, you’ll now find Spier on our menu, ready to elevate your night.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why Spier?</h3>
<p>It’s not just about the wine (although trust us, the wine alone is reason enough). Spier is a local treasure. With over 300 years of history, a commitment to sustainability, and a passion for crafting exceptional wines, they embody everything we love about Cape Town’s artisan spirit.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s something about knowing your drink comes from just down the road that makes every sip taste a little better.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Come Taste the Difference</h3>
<p>Starting now, Spier Wines are officially pouring at La Shebeen. Whether you’re dropping by for an intimate conversation, a quiet toast, or just a really good glass of wine, you’ll experience Stellenbosch’s finest in every pour.</p>
<p>So, next time you visit, grab a glass of Spier and let us know what you think. Or better yet, let the wine speak for itself.</p>
<p>Cheers to supporting local legends, one bottle at a time. 🥂</p>

<p>📅 <strong>Date:</strong> 24th December 2024<br>⏰ <strong>Time:</strong> 18:00 onwards<br>📍 <strong>Where:</strong> You know the drill. (And if you don’t… well, you’re not on the list 😉)</p>
<h3>What to Expect:</h3>
<p>🎁 <strong>Secret Santa with a Twist:</strong> Bring a gift under R200—think strange, quirky, or delightfully ridiculous. No boring socks or generic candles here; this is La Shebeen, after all. The more "What is this?!" the better.</p>
<p>🍸 <strong>Festive Craft Drinks:</strong> Sip on limited-edition holiday specials featuring Hout Bay gin, locally brewed Christmas ales, and our signature Karoo agave creations. (Because eggnog is overrated, obviously.)</p>
<p>🍴 <strong>Delectable Eats:</strong> Menu under construction...</p>
<p>🎄 <strong>Vibe:</strong> No blaring carols. Just warm, cozy conversations and that unique La Shebeen charm that feels like home—if your home also served excellent craft drinks.</p>

<p><strong>P.S.</strong> If you’re debating whether to come: remember, our drinks are better than your family’s mulled wine. Just saying.</p>

<p>We had the legendary Joe behind the bar, the best barman—just incredible. He was serving the most amazing beverages you've ever tasted. People couldn't get enough. Joe's a master, truly one of a kind, like no other. Nobody makes drinks like Joe—believe me.</p>

<p>And the extras, wow—let me tell you, there were some "special" mushroom chocolates and home-grown hash brownies. Incredible stuff, really, the best. People were talking about new dimensions, different planets. Some say they saw the future—they saw greatness! I’m telling you, it was like a trip to another universe, people were thrilled. Such a fantastic time, everyone was winning, everyone was loving it.</p>

                <p>Hearken, ye patrons and kindred spirits, to a tale as old as nectar itself, yet as fresh as the dawn upon the cresting hills! For I sing of La Shebeen, that hallowed haunt of mirth and revelry, which hath been graced by the gods with a gift most rare.</p>
<p>In the age when the world was young, and the gods themselves walked among the verdant groves, a piece of wood, hewn by divine hands, was gifted to the mortal realm. This was no ordinary timber, but a sacred relic, destined to grace the bar of La Shebeen. It bore the whispers of Olympus and the strength of Titans, awaiting its noble fate.</p>

<p>Under the careful gaze of skilled artisans, this celestial wood was shaped and molded, its destiny to support the elbows of weary travelers and the dreams of thirsty souls. Each curve and cut was a testament to the craftsman’s art, the wood bending to their will, as if Aphrodite herself charmed it to beauty.</p>

<figure class="post__image"><br>And what of the finish, you ask? Ah, from Marlon's "<a href="https://kingshardware.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King's Hardware</a>" – a shoppe as famed in these parts as the Oracle at Delphi – came a varnish fit for royalty. This was not merely a protective coat, but a potion of luster, imbuing the bar top with a sheen like the golden chariot of Helios. This varnish, laid upon the wood with care and reverence, did seal its fate and beauty, protecting it as a shield does a warrior.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/IMG_20240511_122815-2.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="1800" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>Now, step into La Shebeen and behold the splendor! The gods themselves smile upon this place, their gift elevating it from mere public house to a pantheon of joy and fellowship. Raise your cups, dear friends, upon this divine counter, and let the nectar of the gods flow freely.</p>
<p>Rejoice, for La Shebeen has been reborn, not just as a bar, but as a monument to celestial grace and human craftsmanship, a place where the divine meets the merry hearts of men. Drink deep from the well of joy, and remember the tale of the bar counter given by the gods, finished by the king’s own elixir, a testament to the glory of old and new.</p>

                <p>In a bizarre and hilarious turn of events, La Shebeen, the popular spot for braai enthusiasts, has become the go-to destination for extraterrestrial visitors craving a taste of Earth's finest culinary delights. Specifically, our world-famous chicken wings on the braai have captured the hearts (and taste buds) of our alien friends from outer space!<br><br>As the sun set on a typical South African afternoon, a group of curious extraterrestrials landed their spaceship in the parking lot, eager to indulge in the local cuisine. With their antennae twitching and their large, round eyes scanning the menu, they zeroed in on the mouthwatering chicken wings. And, oh, they were not disappointed!</p>

<p>Crispy, juicy, and full of flavor, the chicken wings on the braai at La Shebeen left the aliens in awe. They devoured the wings with reckless abandon, their long, slender fingers licking the sauce off with gusto. It was a sight to behold, as they danced and chirped in delight, their spaceship's headlights flashing in approval.<br><br>"We came to Earth seeking new life and new civilizations," said Zorvath, the leader of the alien group. "But we never expected to find such divine culinary creations! The chicken wings at La Shebeen are out of this world – literally!"<br><br>The aliens vowed to return with more of their friends, promising to bring their own secret sauce to share with the La Shebeen team. And, as they took off into the night sky, the sounds of their laughter and wing-induced euphoria echoed through the cosmos.<br><br>So, the next time you're enjoying a plate of La Shebeen's famous chicken wings, remember: you're not just satisfying your cravings, you're representing Earth's culinary prowess to the galaxy!<br><br>Come for the wings, stay for the extraterrestrial entertainment – only at La Shebeen!</p>

                <p>Ladies, gentlemen, and those who may or may not be on the VIP list – we're about to drop the ultimate party invitation for the most exclusive New Year's Eve bash of 2023! Get ready to ring in the new year in style (or not), because "La Shebeen" is about to turn up the sass and sophistication!</p>
<p><strong>Event Details:<br></strong>📅 <strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, 31st December 2023</p>
<p>🕺 <strong>Dress Code:</strong> Here at "La Shebeen," we believe in individuality. So, wear whatever makes you feel like a rockstar, a wizard, or a disco ball. Your choice, really! After all, it's the attire that sets the tone for world domination (or, you know, a great party).</p>
<p>🍹 <strong>Food &amp; Drinks:</strong> Of course, we've got you covered with delectable dishes and drinks that will make your taste buds do the cha-cha. But, just a gentle reminder, donations for the Shebeen bar are always appreciated. It's like bringing sunscreen to a beach party – not necessary, but greatly admired.</p>
<p><strong>The Address: A Little Secret<br></strong>Now, the most intriguing part – we won't tell you the address upfront. Nope, you'll have to be a bit of a Sherlock Holmes to crack this case. Invitations, like treasure maps, will be sent via direct message to a select few.</p>
<p><strong>But What if You Don't Get an Invite?<br></strong>If you didn't receive a direct message with the address, well, don't be too downhearted. It just means you haven't found the secret door to this year's soirée. Keep your eyes peeled, befriend a party insider, or consult a psychic – who knows, maybe next year, you'll make the list!</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about expectations. This party is the stuff of legends. It's the kind of event where fireworks in the sky are the least exciting thing happening. It's a night of revelry, laughter, and maybe even a little chaos. But hey, isn't that what New Year's Eve is all about?</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, you might be invited, you might not. But if you are, congrats, you're in for a night to remember! And if not, well, there's always 2024. Here's to a spectacular New Year's Eve, whether you're with us or on your own adventure. Cheers to a fabulous 2023! 🥂🎆 #LaShebeenNYE #SecretPartySociety</p>

                <p>At La Shebeen, we proved that good food and interstellar company are a universal language! After an exhilarating evening of socializing with our newfound friends from outer space, we decided to whip up a last-minute feast. On the menu? Our world-famous chicken strips! It’s not every day you get to share your favorite Earth delicacies with extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/IMG_20231119_021410.jpg" alt="Chicken Strips at La Shebeen" width="4000" height="1800" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>But wait, there's more. Our evening took a quirky turn when a slug (yes, a real slug!) made an unexpected appearance. We couldn't help but chuckle at the irony. There we were, enjoying chicken strips with aliens, and along slithers a slug, possibly hoping to find some lettuce. Oh, the disappointment on its tiny slug face when it realized La Shebeen isn't quite the 'Slug and Lettuce'!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/1700486873814.jpg" alt="The Slug at La Shebeen" width="1379" height="1162" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>It’s almost as if the universe was playing its own cosmic joke, giving a nod to the famous pub chain but with a La Shebeen twist. Sorry, little slug, no greens here – just crispy, delicious chicken and some out-of-this-world company!</p>
<p>So, here's to spontaneous intergalactic friendships, laughter, and the reminder that sometimes, the best evenings are those that go completely off script (and menu). And to our slug friend: better luck next time in your quest for lettuce! 🚀🐔🌌🌿</p>
