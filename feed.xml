People are saying it's the best birthday bash they've ever seen, and they are right! Nobody does it quite like me and, of course, La Shebeen. Big, big deal.<br><br></p>

<p>We had the legendary Joe behind the bar, the best barman—just incredible. He was serving the most amazing beverages you've ever tasted. People couldn't get enough. Joe's a master, truly one of a kind, like no other. Nobody makes drinks like Joe—believe me.</p>

<p>And the extras, wow—let me tell you, there were some "special" mushroom chocolates and home-grown hash brownies. Incredible stuff, really, the best. People were talking about new dimensions, different planets. Some say they saw the future—they saw greatness! I’m telling you, it was like a trip to another universe, people were thrilled. Such a fantastic time, everyone was winning, everyone was loving it.</p>

                <p>Hearken, ye patrons and kindred spirits, to a tale as old as nectar itself, yet as fresh as the dawn upon the cresting hills! For I sing of La Shebeen, that hallowed haunt of mirth and revelry, which hath been graced by the gods with a gift most rare.</p>
<p>In the age when the world was young, and the gods themselves walked among the verdant groves, a piece of wood, hewn by divine hands, was gifted to the mortal realm. This was no ordinary timber, but a sacred relic, destined to grace the bar of La Shebeen. It bore the whispers of Olympus and the strength of Titans, awaiting its noble fate.</p>

<p>Under the careful gaze of skilled artisans, this celestial wood was shaped and molded, its destiny to support the elbows of weary travelers and the dreams of thirsty souls. Each curve and cut was a testament to the craftsman’s art, the wood bending to their will, as if Aphrodite herself charmed it to beauty.</p>

<figure class="post__image"><br>And what of the finish, you ask? Ah, from Marlon's "<a href="https://kingshardware.co.za/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">King's Hardware</a>" – a shoppe as famed in these parts as the Oracle at Delphi – came a varnish fit for royalty. This was not merely a protective coat, but a potion of luster, imbuing the bar top with a sheen like the golden chariot of Helios. This varnish, laid upon the wood with care and reverence, did seal its fate and beauty, protecting it as a shield does a warrior.<br><br><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/IMG_20240511_122815-2.jpg" alt="" width="4000" height="1800" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/11/responsive/IMG_20240511_122815-2-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>Now, step into La Shebeen and behold the splendor! The gods themselves smile upon this place, their gift elevating it from mere public house to a pantheon of joy and fellowship. Raise your cups, dear friends, upon this divine counter, and let the nectar of the gods flow freely.</p>
<p>Rejoice, for La Shebeen has been reborn, not just as a bar, but as a monument to celestial grace and human craftsmanship, a place where the divine meets the merry hearts of men. Drink deep from the well of joy, and remember the tale of the bar counter given by the gods, finished by the king’s own elixir, a testament to the glory of old and new.</p>

                <p>In a bizarre and hilarious turn of events, La Shebeen, the popular spot for braai enthusiasts, has become the go-to destination for extraterrestrial visitors craving a taste of Earth's finest culinary delights. Specifically, our world-famous chicken wings on the braai have captured the hearts (and taste buds) of our alien friends from outer space!<br><br>As the sun set on a typical South African afternoon, a group of curious extraterrestrials landed their spaceship in the parking lot, eager to indulge in the local cuisine. With their antennae twitching and their large, round eyes scanning the menu, they zeroed in on the mouthwatering chicken wings. And, oh, they were not disappointed!</p>

<p>Crispy, juicy, and full of flavor, the chicken wings on the braai at La Shebeen left the aliens in awe. They devoured the wings with reckless abandon, their long, slender fingers licking the sauce off with gusto. It was a sight to behold, as they danced and chirped in delight, their spaceship's headlights flashing in approval.<br><br>"We came to Earth seeking new life and new civilizations," said Zorvath, the leader of the alien group. "But we never expected to find such divine culinary creations! The chicken wings at La Shebeen are out of this world – literally!"<br><br>The aliens vowed to return with more of their friends, promising to bring their own secret sauce to share with the La Shebeen team. And, as they took off into the night sky, the sounds of their laughter and wing-induced euphoria echoed through the cosmos.<br><br>So, the next time you're enjoying a plate of La Shebeen's famous chicken wings, remember: you're not just satisfying your cravings, you're representing Earth's culinary prowess to the galaxy!<br><br>Come for the wings, stay for the extraterrestrial entertainment – only at La Shebeen!</p>

                <p>Ladies, gentlemen, and those who may or may not be on the VIP list – we're about to drop the ultimate party invitation for the most exclusive New Year's Eve bash of 2023! Get ready to ring in the new year in style (or not), because "La Shebeen" is about to turn up the sass and sophistication!</p>
<p><strong>Event Details:<br></strong>📅 <strong>Date:</strong> Sunday, 31st December 2023</p>
<p>🕺 <strong>Dress Code:</strong> Here at "La Shebeen," we believe in individuality. So, wear whatever makes you feel like a rockstar, a wizard, or a disco ball. Your choice, really! After all, it's the attire that sets the tone for world domination (or, you know, a great party).</p>
<p>🍹 <strong>Food &amp; Drinks:</strong> Of course, we've got you covered with delectable dishes and drinks that will make your taste buds do the cha-cha. But, just a gentle reminder, donations for the Shebeen bar are always appreciated. It's like bringing sunscreen to a beach party – not necessary, but greatly admired.</p>
<p><strong>The Address: A Little Secret<br></strong>Now, the most intriguing part – we won't tell you the address upfront. Nope, you'll have to be a bit of a Sherlock Holmes to crack this case. Invitations, like treasure maps, will be sent via direct message to a select few.</p>
<p><strong>But What if You Don't Get an Invite?<br></strong>If you didn't receive a direct message with the address, well, don't be too downhearted. It just means you haven't found the secret door to this year's soirée. Keep your eyes peeled, befriend a party insider, or consult a psychic – who knows, maybe next year, you'll make the list!</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about expectations. This party is the stuff of legends. It's the kind of event where fireworks in the sky are the least exciting thing happening. It's a night of revelry, laughter, and maybe even a little chaos. But hey, isn't that what New Year's Eve is all about?</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, you might be invited, you might not. But if you are, congrats, you're in for a night to remember! And if not, well, there's always 2024. Here's to a spectacular New Year's Eve, whether you're with us or on your own adventure. Cheers to a fabulous 2023! 🥂🎆 #LaShebeenNYE #SecretPartySociety</p>

                <p>At La Shebeen, we proved that good food and interstellar company are a universal language! After an exhilarating evening of socializing with our newfound friends from outer space, we decided to whip up a last-minute feast. On the menu? Our world-famous chicken strips! It’s not every day you get to share your favorite Earth delicacies with extraterrestrial beings.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/IMG_20231119_021410.jpg" alt="Chicken Strips at La Shebeen" width="4000" height="1800" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/IMG_20231119_021410-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>But wait, there's more. Our evening took a quirky turn when a slug (yes, a real slug!) made an unexpected appearance. We couldn't help but chuckle at the irony. There we were, enjoying chicken strips with aliens, and along slithers a slug, possibly hoping to find some lettuce. Oh, the disappointment on its tiny slug face when it realized La Shebeen isn't quite the 'Slug and Lettuce'!</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/1700486873814.jpg" alt="The Slug at La Shebeen" width="1379" height="1162" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 1360px" srcset="https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-xs.jpg 300w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-sm.jpg 480w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-md.jpg 768w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://www.lashebeen.co.za/media/posts/8/responsive/1700486873814-xl.jpg 1360w"></figure>
<p>It’s almost as if the universe was playing its own cosmic joke, giving a nod to the famous pub chain but with a La Shebeen twist. Sorry, little slug, no greens here – just crispy, delicious chicken and some out-of-this-world company!</p>
<p>So, here's to spontaneous intergalactic friendships, laughter, and the reminder that sometimes, the best evenings are those that go completely off script (and menu). And to our slug friend: better luck next time in your quest for lettuce! 🚀🐔🌌🌿</p>

                <p>Ah, chicken wings, the culinary sensation that transcends language barriers, cultural divides, and apparently, even the dictionary itself! Here at "La Shebeen," we take our chicken wings seriously, with a side of humor and a dash of linguistic ambiguity.</p>
<p>So, let's talk about "waddage," shall we? According to our very special guest, Ross, "waddage" means something that's large. And when it comes to our chicken wings, they're so "waddage" that they might just redefine your perception of what's possible in the world of wings.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more! According to the Urban Dictionary, "waddage" has an entirely different meaning that we won't delve into here – let's just say it involves some creative uses for public paper towels. Yeah, we'll stick with the "large and in charge" definition, thanks!</p>
<p>And if you thought "waddage" was just a quirky word, think again. According to Google Translate, "waddage" translates to "road" in Somali. Now, we're not entirely sure how that connects to chicken wings, but hey, language is a mysterious thing, and maybe there's a chicken wing road we don't know about!</p>

<p>But back to the star of the show – our world-famous chicken wings. These bad boys are so irresistible that even the most linguistically challenged among us can appreciate their crispy, flavorful glory. Whether you like 'em spicy, saucy, or plain ol' finger-lickin' good, we've got the "waddage" of wings to satisfy your cravings.</p>

                <p>Oh, what a night! The echoes of revelry are still bouncing off the chic walls of La Shebeen, where Fabien’s 40th birthday bash went down in history— and by history, we mean those blurry memories we’ll be piecing together for weeks.</p>
<p>Firstly, we extend a heartily ironic thanks to all you party animals who brought more life to the party than Fabien’s new age bracket might suggest. You all made the night as special as a unicorn in a tuxedo— rare, magical, and slightly bewildering.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about the vodka that flowed like an enchanted river— so smooth, it was like hydrating with a touch of mischief. This wasn’t your average liquor; oh no, it was so refined and clear, it had the Russians nodding with approval from across the globe, raising their glasses to the sky and saying, “That’s how you turn 40.”</p>
<p>As the evening unfolded, the dance floor became a melting pot of moves from decades past— a wrinkle in time, if you will. There were enough spins, dips, and Saturday night fever poses to make John Travolta quiver in his boots. And when the beat dropped, so did any pretense of adulthood. Because at La Shebeen, age is just a number, but dance is eternal.</p>
<p>Every laugh, every toast, every “cheers” to Fabien’s questionable maturity level made the evening sparkle brighter than the twinkle in his eye when he spotted the vodka bottle. It’s safe to say that the water of life was so pure, it could be served in a health spa.</p>
<p>And to Fabien, our VIP of the hour who proved you can be forty and still party like it’s 1999— your joy was contagious, your spirits were high, and your liver, well, resilient.</p>
<p>As the night drew to a close, the only thing clearer than that top-shelf vodka was the love and friendship filling the room—proof that the best way to age is surrounded by good people and great drinks.</p>
<p>To all who came, laughed, and sipped the night away: thank you from the bottom of our hearts (and the bottom of the bottle). You’ve made Fabien’s leap into the “Fab Forties” as memorable as that vodka was forgettable.</p>
<p>Here’s to nights we’ll always remember with friends we’ll never forget...and to vodka so smooth, it's basically water—Fabien-style.</p>
<p>With affection and a hint of aspirin, The La Shebeen Team</p>
<p>P.S. Don’t worry, your secrets are safe with us. What happens at La Shebeen stays at La Shebeen... until it ends up in our commemorative photo album. Cheers to the next 40, Fabien! 🥳🍸</p>

                <p>Ladies, gents, and those who may or may not be on the guest list – hold onto your party hats, because something fabulous is brewing! That's right, the elusive Fabien, our culinary genius, is turning the big 4-0, and you might (or might not) be invited to the shindig of the century!</p>
<p><strong>Event Details:</strong></p>
<p>📆 <strong>Date:</strong> Saturday, 4th November 2023 at 18:00</p>
<p>🕺 <strong>Dress Code:</strong> Well, darlings, wear whatever tickles your fancy. Whether you're rocking your grandma's sequin dress, a three-piece suit, or a onesie, you do you. We don't judge; we celebrate!</p>
<p>🍹 <strong>Food &amp; Drinks:</strong> Of course, we've got you covered with the finest food and cocktails this side of the moon. Fabien's in charge, after all! But hey, we're not opposed to donations for the Shebeen bar. It's like bringing a bottle of wine to a wine tasting, only classier.</p>
<p><strong>The Address: A Little Secret</strong></p>
<p>Now, for the secret handshake... drumroll, please... we won't tell you the address. That's right, you'll have to be a real-life Sherlock Holmes to find us! Invitations, like treasure maps, will be sent via direct message to the chosen few.</p>
<p><strong>But What if You Don't Get an Invite?</strong></p>
<p>If you didn't receive a direct message with the address, well, bless your heart, you might not be on the list. But don't fret! It just means you haven't unlocked the secret code to the party of the year. Keep rubbing those four-leaf clovers, maybe next time you'll get lucky!</p>
<p>Now, let's be honest – this party is the kind of event you'll tell your grandkids about. It's an exclusive soirée, where good times and laughter are mandatory. Fabien's 40th is bound to be legendary, a bit wild, and absolutely unforgettable.</p>
<p>So, in conclusion, you might be invited, you might not. But if you are, congratulations! You're in for a night to remember. And if you're not, well, there's always next time. Cheers, fabulous friends, and here's to Fabien turning 40 in style! 🎂🎈 #FabienTurns40 #LaShebeenSecrets</p>

<p>If you're reading this, congratulations! You're already one step closer to joining the exclusive club that is "La Shebeen." But just in case you need a nudge in the right direction, here's how you can get in touch with us:</p>
<p><strong>1. The Secret Phone Line 📞</strong></p>
<p>Our direct line is so secret, even Sherlock Holmes would struggle to find it. But for the well-informed, dialing it is a breeze. If you've got the number, you're on the guest list.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Whispering Bartender 🍹</strong></p>
<p>When you're enjoying the fine libations at "La Shebeen," just ask the bartender. They've got the inside scoop on everything, including how to contact us. They won't just tell anyone, so make sure to ask with a wink and a nod.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Local Grapevine 🍇</strong></p>
<p>Word of mouth is our preferred mode of communication. If you're not hearing about us from your friends or the grapevine, you might be living in the wrong reality. Ask around - someone's bound to let you in on the secret.</p>
<p><strong>4. Smoke Signals (just kidding) 🌫️</strong></p>
<p>We'd love to claim that we communicate via smoke signals or carrier pigeons, but alas, we're not quite that sophisticated. But trust us; if you're in the know, you'll know how to reach us.</p>
<p><strong>5. The Not-So-Secret Address 🏠</strong></p>
<p>As for our physical location, well, if you don't know where "La Shebeen" is, it's quite simple – you're clearly not in the know. But don't worry, the real aficionados have a GPS built into their souls, leading them straight to our doorstep.</p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking, "How can I get on the inside track and learn the secrets of 'La Shebeen'?" The answer is simple: immerse yourself in the culture, meet fellow enthusiasts, and keep your ear to the ground. Once you've unlocked the mystique, you'll find that getting in touch with us is as easy as ordering a cold beer on a hot day.</p>
<p>So, to all the in-the-know adventurers, we can't wait to hear from you. And to the rest, well, don't worry, someday you might just discover the secret path to "La Shebeen."</p>
<p>Remember, "La Shebeen" is not just a place; it's a state of mind. If you're here, you're in it. If not, well, you've got some exploring to do.</p>
<p>Yours mysteriously,</p>
<p>The "La Shebeen" Team 🍻🔮</p>
